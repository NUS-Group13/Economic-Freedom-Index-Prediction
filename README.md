# Economic Freedom Index Prediction - NUS Internship
This project has been made by group 13 under Batch 1 of the GAIP Internship programme completed at NUS. Batch 1 consisted of 6 participants.

In this project we have used 8-10 types of Classification models to predict classes assigned to different coutries based on their economic index score. The dataset used is publically available and obtained from the heritage organisation. The combined dataset consists of multiple features from different countries and their respective rankings for the time period of 2013-2022

To use used dataset is divided in 3 parts - Classification_dataset (Raw Data), Visualisation_dataset (Used for visualisations) and finally preprocessed_data.csv (For model training and testing). Regarding the model training and testing they are also divided in 2 parts - training_and_testing.ipynb (all models except ANN model) and ANN.ipynb (for ANN Model). One needs to use all these together to understand the whole project.

The following prediction model and results have also been uploaded on a website made with streamlit
